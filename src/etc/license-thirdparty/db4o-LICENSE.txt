db4o Software Redistribution License Agreement and
db4o Developer Network Membership Agreement
Terms and Conditions
1. Subject
This Contract defines the Customer’s right to use and redistribute the Software and to obtain technical support for the Software. In all cases, Software is licensed and not sold.
1.1. “Software” means the current version of the db4o Software and the dRS Software, and all patches, bug fixes, error corrections, updates and future versions that are generally released by Versant during the Contract Periods. “db4o Software” means the db4o database engine libraries db4o-[version]-java*.jar (for Java) and Db4objects.Db4o.dll (for .NET). “dRS Software” means the db4o Replication System libraries dRS-[version]-core.jar (for Java) and Db4objects.Drs.dll (for .NET).
1.2 Software does not include Add-on packages, such as Hibernate, Ant, or Bloat (“Add-ons”) which are not part of Versants' explicitly copyrighted products, even if aggregated with the Software's distribution files. Add-ons are licensed directly between the Customer and the respective copyright holders of the Add-ons.
2. Software Licenses
2.1. During the Contract Periods, provided that the Customer has not breached this Contract, the Customer may
(a) redistribute inside and outside the Customer's organization copies of the db4o Software and, if included, the dRS Software (the db4o Software and dRS Software collectively referred to as “Runtimes”), solely as embedded in the Customer Application, and solely to end users of the Customer Application;
(b) grant to these end users a perpetual right to use the Runtimes; and
(c) download, use, and redistribute updates of the Runtimes on the same terms and conditions.
2.2. Runtimes licensed by Versant under this Contract and Runtimes licensed by Versant under the GPL license are obtained from the same source, the Versant – a.k.a. db4objects' Web site, and may be flagged as governed by the GPL license by default. In those situations, Customer may remove Versant’ GPL notices, flags and terms from any such Runtimes that are governed by this Contract.
2.3. If the In-Process or Micro modes/versions are selected, Customer may not and will not use or license the Software to connect to a database server with the Db4o#openClient() methods (as opposed to Db4o#openFile()). In addition, if the Micro mode/version is selected, the Software is licensed to run solely on the J2ME and Microsoft .NET CompactFramework platforms.
2.4. The rights granted in this Section 2 are non-exclusive and non-transferable. All rights not explicitly granted to the Customer are reserved by Versant.
3. Restrictions
3.1. Customer’s rights under Section 2 end immediately at the end of the last Contract Period (see also Section 8 below).
3.2. Customer may not redistribute or grant rights to the Software on a standalone basis. The Customer Application must not be a database engine itself and must add substantial features of its own beyond just the Software.
3.3. The Customer may not extract or copy the content of the Software or any part thereof to any other data form.
3.4. The end user of the Customer Application does not receive any rights to use the Software on a standalone basis, separate from the Customer Application, or as part of any other application.
4. Runtime License Fee Calculation
4.1. If In-Process or Micro Modes/Versions have been selected, one Runtime corresponds to the use of the Runtime on one CPU. Use on each additional CPU requires the purchase of additional Runtimes.
4.2. If Client/Server Mode/Version has been selected, one Runtime corresponds to the use of the Runtime on one server CPU with up to two cores and an unlimited number of client connections to this server. Use on each additional server CPU or each additional two cores requires the purchase of additional Runtimes.
4.3. The Base Order Amount will remain in effect for the next Contract Period unless the Customer and Versant mutually agree on a revised Base Order Amount and correspondingly revised pricing within the first fifteen (15) days of the next Contract Period.
4.4. Within fifteen (15) days of the beginning of each Contract Period, the Customer will pay to Versant the total license fee for the entire Base Order Amount, based on the dRT unit price. The Customer will then have the right to redistribute this number of dRT licenses during the Contract Period.
4.5. If Customer requires more dRT licenses than the Base Order Amount during a Contract Period, then Customer shall order additional dRT licenses in batches of the Base Order Amount. The Customer will pay to Versant the total license fee for the entire Base Order Amount, based on the dRT unit price. Customer will pay these license fees within fifteen (15) days after invoicing.
4.6. Any dRT licenses purchased at the beginning or during a Contract Period that remain unsold may be transferred into the next Contract Period.
4.7. If this Contract ends before the Customer purchases the Minimum Total Order Amount of dRT licenses (cumulatively, for all Contract Periods), then the Customer must pay to Versant the lesser of (a) the amount due if the Customer had additionally purchased the shortfall in the number of dRT licenses on the last day of the last Contract Period; and (b) the amount due if the Customer had purchased all of its dRT licenses at Versant’s published unit price as of the last day of the last Contract Period instead of at the actual prices provided under this Contract.
5. Developer Network Support (dDN)
5.1. During the Contract Periods, Customer is entitled to receive e-mail answers to support case requests

(“Cases”) entered by Web form on Versant’s – a.k.a. db4objects' Customer Portal (https://customer.db4o.com) by the Named Members. Versant will attempt to answer all Cases within twenty-four (24) hours upon receiving the request.
5.2. Support is limited to the Named Members and to issues regarding unmodified versions of the Software qualified by Versant as “development”, “production”, or “stable” at any given time. Customer may change the Named Members at any time by written notice. Customer may add additional Named Members at any time, in which case Customer will pay a pro-rata dDN-E membership fee for Named Members that are added after the start of a Contract Period. Customer may delete Named Members at the end of a Contract Period by written notice. Unless Customer gives such written notice, Named Members will automatically continue into the next Contract Period.
5.3. For capacity calculation purposes, Versant may refuse support services if the total cumulative effort exceeds 10 hours per any year per Named Membership. Support is limited to current and un-modified versions of the Software.
5.4. Customer will pay dDN membership fees within the first fifteen (15) days of each Contract Period and fifteen (15) days of the end of the calendar quarter for Named Members that are added during the calendar quarter.
6. Payments and Audit
6.1. If credit card is selected as the payment method, then Customer agrees to pay all outstanding fees by credit card. Customer will provide its valid credit card number, name of holder, expiration date, and card verification code (CVC) and authorize Versant to deduct all payments due from this credit card at any time during the Contract Periods.
6.2. Failure to pay on time or to provide valid credit card information will result in a one-time US$100 handling fee as well as 1.5% interest charge per month (or the highest rate allowed by law) on the overdue amount outstanding.
6.3. Customer will keep accounts for all dRT licenses distributed. Within five (5) days after the end of every calendar quarter, Customer will report to Versant the number of dRT licenses redistributed in that quarter.
6.4. Versant has the right to send an auditor selected by Versant to audit Customer’s accounts to verify Customer’s compliance with this Contract. If Customer’s report or license fees are not correct, Customer will immediately pay any additional amounts due and will also pay the expense of the audit if the audit uncovers an underpayment of more than five percent (5%).
6.5. Customer will pay all amounts due under this Contract in U.S. currency. All fees payable under this Contract are net amounts and are payable in full, without deduction for taxes or duties of any kind. If Versant is required to collect any tax for which Customer is responsible, Customer will pay such tax directly to Versant.
7. Publicity
Versant may publicize Customer’s use of the Software in the Customer Application as part of Versants’ efforts to market the Software, provided that Customer has approved of the publicity which approval will not be unreasonably withheld.
8. Termination and Transfer
8.1. The term of this Contract ends at the end of the last Contract Period or any special term provided in the Special Terms below. If this Contract is earlier terminated, then the Contract Period will also terminate at the same time.
8.2. After the end of the last Contract Period, unless the Contract was terminated due to Customer’s breach, Customer may continue to
(a) redistribute already purchased but still undistributed Runtimes to end users of the Customer Application; and
(b) grant to end users a perpetual right to use such Surplus Runtimes.
8.3. Customer will not update the Software with versions that were published after termination of this Contract.
8.4. Either party may terminate this Contract immediately upon written notice to the other party, if the other party materially breaches this Contract and fails to cure that breach within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of the breach. The licenses granted under this Contact will terminate if any payment of Customer to Versant is overdue by more than sixty (60) days.
8.5. The rights and obligations of the parties contained in Sections 3, 6, 7, 8.5, and 9 through 11 will survive the termination of this Contract.

Subject to the foregoing, this Contract will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's successors and permitted assigns.
