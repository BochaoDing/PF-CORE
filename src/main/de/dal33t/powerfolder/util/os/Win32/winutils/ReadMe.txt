Compiling howto:

I used Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition, I'd recommend you to use that too.
Open the MyProbs property sheet and goto user macros and change java_path to the location of your
java installation.
The build process will call javac and javah on SystemFolders.java - no need to do it yourself beforehand.
