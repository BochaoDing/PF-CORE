This is a demonstration of a custom PowerFolder Skin. It introduces a custom look
and feel and a replacem,ent PowerFolder logo.

The only difference between it and the standard Synthetica LAF is that it has
green text (see the synth.xml SyntheticaDefaultFont). The Logo has the word 'Demo'.
To compile, use the 'demo' buld target, then include the CustomLookAndFeel.jar
in the class path, e.g.

 java -cp ./PowerFolder.jar;./CustomLookAndFeel.jar de.dal33t.powerfolder.PowerFolder

The LAF will then appear in Preferences / User Interface / Color theme combo,
and will function as a normal Synthetica LAF. The Logo wil replace the normal one.
